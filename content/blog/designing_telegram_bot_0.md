I was challenged by my [girlfriend] to practice or study something for 30 days and post it online. A great excuse to start a project, don't you think? This time I want to work in a project that ends up being useful for ordinary people and actually has users. The last time this happened was when I plotted [market data] from a minecraft server.

But I also want to focus on quality. That is I would like the codebase to be small, well-documented, minimize the frequency of bugs and also to quickly discover the bugs that end up happening.

# The Problem

When I hang out with my friends I would like to split the bill proportionally what each person ordered. Generally someone pays everything, or the bill is split evenly because more precise calculations and payments would take so long it's not worth it.

> To split the bill nicely it's sufficient to write some kind of software that does it precisely and quicker than the aforementioned alternatives.

We already concluded something interesting! When we have something running we should compare it to the alternatives to see if we have achieved our goal.
