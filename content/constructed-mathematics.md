Some years ago I learned about the existence of a kind of mathematics called Constructive Mathematics. If you practice math using this style, every proof of existence you write will also provide you an algorithm to actually find what you were seeking. And I mean a real algorithm which you can run in your computer and observe the result. Of course this isn't the only reason to appreciate constructive mathematics. Indeed, if you look at most repositories of constructive mathematics online, it's generally possible to check the correctness of the proofs with a computer — a nice advance compared with pencil and paper mathematics, which requires a specialist to check — but it's hard or impossible to execute the corresponding algorithms. Actually, the only example of a theorem/algorithm which really is meant to be used

Actually the only example of constructive math theorem that is intended to be ran as an algorithm for lay people is CompCert. The reason for this is that there are some technical challenges to
